DISCLAIMER:
The one line description of the problem is vague. In real life development, I would usually talk with product owner 
or whoever define the problem to clarify any ambiguities. For the purpose of completing this off-site interview assignment, 
I just proceed design the solution with following assumptions.

Assumptions:
* The parking lot has a simple structure which only contains entries, exits and parking spaces.
* The parking lot is single level.
* Vehicle can enter the parking lot instantly long as there is one entry is open. ie. no gate congestion.
* Exits are always open.
